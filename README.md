Hello! My name is Joshua Hoashin and I'm a current student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I'm a programmer with several years of experience. Today, my sights are set high and I continue to explore new and upcoming technologies. Through my time studying, and through my several projects I am proficient in Python, Java, C, HTML/CSS/Javascript, SQL, and much more. In the future, I hope to pursue an education in Computer Science.
